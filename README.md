# CG-lab-pgms
Programs are compiled using Dev-C++
Important Glut libraries that must use to run these programs are:
- [lopengl32]
- [lfreeglut]
- [lglu32]

# Lab Program-1:
Implement Bresenhamâ€™s line drawing algorithm for all types of slope. 
26
# Lab Program-2:
Create and rotate a triangle about the origin and a fixed point. 
 
# Lab Program-3:
Draw a color cube and spin it using OpenGL transformation matrices.

# Lab Program-4:
Draw a color cube and allow the user to move the camera suitably to 
experiment with perspective viewing.

# Lab Program-5:
Clip a lines using Cohen-Sutherland Algorithm.

# Lab Program-6:
To draw a simple shaded scene consisting of a tea pot on a table. Define 
suitably the position and properties of the light source along with the 
properties of the surfaces of the solid object used in the scene.

# Lab Program-7:
Design, develop and implement recursively subdivide a tetrahedron to form 
3D Sierpinski gasket. The number of recursive steps is to be specified by 
the user.

# Lab Program-8:
Develop a menu driven program to animate a flag using Bezier Curve 
algorithm 

# Lab Program-9:
Develop a menu driven program to fill the polygon using scan line 
algorithm
